## GitHub

I was new to GitHub this year, my first impression is that it was a knowck off discord but quickly learned it was lot more complicated than that. 
so far ive leanred how to create a repository and collabaorate with teamates and bounce ideas off of each other.


## Xcode 

I was also new to Xcode and it has been by far one of my favorite programs to use, in the program ive leanred how to create and app and
test it as well as playa round with the apps format. its amazing to bringing ideas to reality.


## Sketch 

Sketch was another program that I started learning about this term its been incredibly helpful for me to scale pictures and put them in my app.
