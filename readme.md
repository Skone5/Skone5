## GitHub

I was new to GitHub this year, my first impression is that it was a knock off discord but quickly learned it was lot more complicated than that. 
so far ive leanred how to create a repository and collabaorate with teamates and bounce ideas off of each other. I was able to collaborate with a group and help with their app idea "Knight" witch is a mobile RPG game. I got to do a little bit of designing for one of the characters weopons.

## [Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight#knight)
This is the gun I made that will be added in the secound version of the game.

## Xcode 

I was also new to Xcode and it has been by far one of my favorite programs to use, in the program if I learned how to create an app and!

test it by playing around with the app. It's amazing for bringing ideas to reality, like my friend's idea for a clothing brand, with her designs, hopefully I will be able to create a visually appealing layout for people to order her clothes from an app. The app is called "Human Earth"

For term two, my and Matthew decided to do our own thing and follow a hackking with swift toutorial to create a fruit ninja app. it was goingn pretty well in the beginning but some where in our process we made an error and we are still looking trying to fix it but its still a work in progess.

## Sketch 

Sketch was another program that I started learning about this term its been incredibly helpful for me to scale pictures and put them in my app.

## Asprite
asprite is another incredibly helpful application i used for the artwork.
